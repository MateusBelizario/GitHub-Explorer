# Welcome to GitHub Explorer!

My name is Mateus Belizario and this is GitHub Explorer. It is a tool for searching for GitHub users and their information.
You can filter by specific names, browse user repositories, and get specific information about them and their public projects.
GitHub explorer was developed in typescript and React, with mobx. For visual components, the Material UI framework was used.
